# ToDos / Next steps:

- creep path-finding with custom cache
    - creep.Memory saves path
    - determine new path in every tick
    - compare new path cost vs. saved path cost => choose cheaper path for move
    - minCost for custom logic ~20 or something?! (avoid clogging)
    - taskManager.finishTask clears creep.Memory path(?)
- new task: pick-up resources from ground (decayed creeps => tombstones or raw resources after tombstone expires, deliberately dropped resources)
    - maybe 2 tasks: random resources (force pick-up) & resources from "around" sources
    - think about how to involve in task priority list
    - separate logic could also determine the nearest creep for force pick-up
        - needs free capacity
        - ground resource could be > free capacity ==> multiple creeps need force pick-up
- new role: miner
    - mining resources and dropping them on the ground for others to pick up
    - potentially: remove harvester or at least don't use it anymore
- potentially new role: transporter
    - no WORK body-parts, only CARRY and MOVE
    - transporting dropped resources to storage units (spawn, extensions, towers, etc)
- build "Links"
- RCL 8: build Observer
